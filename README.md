# Iranian-Churn-Dataset-Data-Set
This dataset is randomly collected from an Iranian telecom companyâ€™s database over a period of 12 months. A total of 3150 rows of data, each representing a customer, bear information for 13 columns. The attributes that are in this dataset are call failures, frequency of SMS, number of complaints, number of distinct calls, subscription length, age group, the charge amount, type of service, seconds of use, status, frequency of use, and Customer Value. In this Project I will attempt to work on the data set and create an SVM model to predict customer churn.

This is my first project to post, I am no expert by any means. Please send me suggestions on how I could improve this post and what else I can add.
